# Cryptocurrency-Analysis

With the advent of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies have gained a lot of importance in today’s digital
world. As cryptocurrencies have direct and indirect effects on multiple domains, we present statistical analysis
to validate the same. These effects being bi-directional and volatile, the analysis becomes intriguing as well as
challenging.

We performed analysis on following areas:

## General Analysis
* We applied Parametric inference of the cryptocurrency data set to get an idea of the distribution.
* We applied Time-Series analysis for the prices of different cryptocurrencies.

## Impact of Google Search Trends
* We studied how Google Searches affected  Cryptocurrency prices using Linear Regression.
* Wald’s test and KS test. 
* We also applied Multiple Linear Regression to find out which feature of cryptocurrencies was most influenced by the Google Searches.

## Impact on financial sector
* We studied how companies producing hardware for mining cryptocurrencies performed with bitcoin prices. 
* We applied Multiple Linear Regression for predicting the stock values of these companies.
* We applied Simple Linear regression for the number of bitcoin investors in Greece increased after the crisis of 2015
* Permutation Test

## Impact of Ransomware Attacks on Bitcoin
* Wald's test for analyzing increase in ransomware attack with number of bitcoin trasactions
* We applied Bayesian Inference to find the posterior distribution of the data subject to new random data generated from the same distribution. 

## Impact of Gambling on Bitcoin
* Wald's Test
* Permutation Test
* Simple and Multiple Linear regression
